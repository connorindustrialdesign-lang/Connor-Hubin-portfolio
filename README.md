# Three-Page Static Website

This folder contains a simple three-page website built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Pages

- `index.html` – Home page with hero section and feature cards.
- `about.html` – About page describing the site and technologies used.
- `contact.html` – Contact page with a basic client-side validated form.

All pages share a common header, navigation, and footer. A small JavaScript file powers:

- Active navigation highlighting based on the current page.
- A light/dark theme toggle (preference stored in `localStorage`).
- Basic contact form validation and user feedback.

## How to view

You can open any of the HTML files directly in your browser:

1. In your file explorer, navigate to this folder.
2. Double-click `index.html` (or open it from your browser with "File → Open").

For a more realistic setup, you can also serve the folder with any static file server of your choice.
